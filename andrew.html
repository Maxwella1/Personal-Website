            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Andrew Maxwell. I live in Ridgewood, NJ and currently go to school at Saint Peter's Preparatory School as a Senior in High School. I am an aspiring software engineer and really enjoy working in Computer Science.

            <h3>As a student</h3>
            <p>
                I am a student currently a senior at Saint Peter's Preparatory  School in Jersey City, NJ. Throughout my highschool career, I have gotten better and better while continuing to challenge myself more each year. I first started programming in my sophomore year of High School with Python in Programming I. I quickly caught on and decided to continue my interest with the Honors Programming course which was taught in C++. I enjoyed this course more than I could have ever imagined, this led me taking a course on Web Development over the summer, which quickly helped me realize that Web Dev is not for me. All my time at High School I have been better at math than any other subject (except Computer Science). My freshman &amp; sophomore year I was in the accelerated mathematics program, but by my sophomore year came around it was getting way too easy and a bit boring. I wanted to move up a level in math since it was clear to me and my teacher that I did not belong in accelerated, so I took a summer course to learn Algebra II in a month and take a test at the end of it  to see if I can move up a level. I not only moved up to Pre-Calculus, but I was pushed all the way up two levels to the highest class for Juniors. As it turns out, I did the best in my class and got the highest score on the test. Consequently, I was bumped past Pre-Calculus, and into Pre-Calculus Honors.

            <h3>As an Athlete</h3>
            <p>
                Throughout my entire life I have played a multitude of sports within my school and community leagues:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Football</li>
                <li>Lacrosse</li>
                <li>Baseball</li>
                <li>etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I honestly didn't know what sport I would play, I was good at all of the sports I was playing at the time, but I wasn't particularly interested in persuing any of them except for lacrosse which I had been playing for eight years. My two older brothers who went to Saint Peter's, one played Lacrosse and Water Polo, and the other rowed crew. Both sports, Water Polo and Crew, caught my eye and I was very interested in trying them. Joining the Water Polo team freshman year, I excelled and won defender of  the year in 2014, and Coaches Award in 2016. I have got a varsity letter my sophmore year and junior year, I was also the Captain of JV when I was a Junior. In crew I only played in the spring season, as it would have interfered with Water Polo if I played fall. When I joined freshman year I was a season behind everyone else on the team and wasn't very good. This ticked me off beyond belief because I had never been the worst at any sport in my entire life and I didn't like, so I trained beginning day one of the season and ended up have the third fastest time on the freshman team and was the bow seat in the best novice boat which went on to race in the Stotesberry cup in 2015. Unfortunately my sophomore did not go as well. Everyone on the team had gotten better and better over the summer and fall while I was training for Water Polo. I no longer had the fastest time on the team and now wasn't quite as good comparitavely. I still was determined to do well, if I wasn't going to be the fastest, I was going to have a strong presence on the team and I wanted to be a strong leader to the younger rowers. I ended up have one of the best forms on the team and was the leader of the JV-B Boat. By the time that states came around we got 3rd in our heat and beat many boats that were better than us in the beginning of the season, this was amazing considering where we started and where we ended up. My Junior however came around and I decided to try out swimming. This was a huge mistake as I was only available for about half the practices and my grades were going down because I was incredibly for the month of December with Bronchitis. This drop in my grades meant that I had to drop Crew for the spring of my Junior year and focus on my grades, as Crew takes more dedication than showing up to half the practices.

            <h3>Boy Scouts</h3>
            <p>
                Ever since I was I joined the Cub Scouts in kindergarten I have loved the Outdoors. I was teh only one in my entire family who enjoyed the outdoors and I liked how it made me stand out from the rest of everyone else. I was hesitant though to joining the boy scouts because I didn't know how I would do with more than a couple days without civilization and that was one of the requirements to get into the troop I was looking at. I decided to do it anyway and found out that not only do I like camping for longer better, but there is an achievement that you can get through Boy Scouts that not many people have achieved and is respected by most members of the society.

            <h3>Computer Science</h3>
            <p>
                I am a person who always enjoys challenging, so naturally I don't have much free time. Over the past several summers I have been preparing myself for college and my aspiration of working as a software engineer and then eventually becoming project leader. Unlike most people who decide before college to become a sofware engineer, I actually know what it is and what that title entales. I really enjoy group work, and am particularaly good at leading a group of people with different levels of skill in the field. As someone who is constantly challenging themselves to do better and always working hard to learn more and better themsleves for the job market, I am confident that my skill will push me far and above the competition. I have talked to many people in field what the best direction to take is and have gotten a lot of good advice and contacts for the future.
